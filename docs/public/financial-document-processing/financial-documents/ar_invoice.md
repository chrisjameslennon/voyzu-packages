# AR\_INVOICE

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="API" %}
`POST /api/finance/process-document/AR_INVOICE`

`POST /api/finance/process-document/AR_INVOICE?preview`

### ?preview parameter

If `preview` is passed as a query string parameter then no ledger posting, subledger entries, or persisted records will be created and no changes will be made to the Voyzu system. The return response will be identical to the response returned for a live request.

The AR\_INVOICE posting endpoint receives a customer invoice and posts it to the Company Ledger, the Accounts Receivable Subledger, and if applicable the Tax Ledger. The engine calculates all derived amounts (line gross, invoice net / tax / gross, per-line tax components) from the supplied lines — callers do not pre-calculate amounts.

### Request Object

An Accounts Receivable Financial Document — a customer invoice — is POST-ed to the endpoint. This is a JSON object containing all values needed to create the necessary financial entries.

This request object has the following notable properties:

* A single AR Counterparty per document is supported. A single AR\_INVOICE cannot be issued to more than one Customer.
* Multiple invoice lines per document are supported. Each line carries its own revenue posting code and tax posting code.
* The AR receivable posting code is fixed at `AR_TRADE_RECEIVABLES` and cannot be overridden by the caller.
* Caller-supplied amounts are limited to `quantity` and `net_unit_price` (or, where the line has no unit basis, `net_line_total`). All other amounts are derived by the engine.

**Annotated Example:**

```

### Response Object

The response to a request to the AR\_INVOICE endpoint is an object containing five sub-objects:

* `detailed_document` The calculated invoice. Includes per-line tax components and resolved posting codes.
* `ar_subledger_details` Accounts Receivable Subledger details resulting from the transaction.
* `ar_counterparty_details` Details of the AR Counterparty retrieved or created.
* `tax_subledger_details` Tax Subledger details resulting from the transaction.
* `posting_details` Details of the Company Ledger journal (header + lines).

```json
{
  "detailed_document":      { /* ... */ },
  "ar_subledger_details":  { /* ... */ },
  "ar_counterparty_details": { /* ... */ },
  "tax_ledger_details": { /* ... */ },
  "posting_details":       { /* ... */ }
}
```

For a `?preview` request the response shape is identical; status fields on subledger and journal records will be `EPHEMERAL` instead of `POSTED`.

## Financial / Ledger Treatment Principles

A high level explanation of the general principles applying to the AR\_INVOICE document processing process. Individual use cases are described in more detail in the "Use cases" section.

### Journal treatment

The engine credits revenue per invoice line using `revenue_posting_code`; if omitted, the default for the `AR_INVOICE.revenue_posting_code` slot is used. Separate revenue journal lines are created per invoice line. If a tax rule resolves to multiple tax components, separate tax journal lines are created per tax component. The debit side is always posted to `AR_TRADE_RECEIVABLES`.

```txt
  AR_INVOICE
  
  Ledger (typical use case):

  Dr Accounts Receivable            1,150.00
    Cr Revenue                      1,000.00
    Cr Tax Output                     150.00

  BY WAY OF:

    Voyzu journal:
      Dr AR_TRADE_RECEIVABLES Control Account
        Cr Default AR_INVOICE.revenue_posting_code,
           or supplied valid revenue posting code
        Cr Tax Output posting code(s), calculated based on the line level Tax Posting code
```

### Posting Code Slots

AR\_INVOICE provides the following posting code slots:

| Slot name              | Scope                          | Description                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `revenue_posting_code` | Header default + line override | Optional posting-code slot used to select the revenue posting target for AR invoice lines. If omitted, the configured default is used. |

### Tax treatment

AR\_INVOICE is a tax relevant document. The tax journal line is classified with the `TAX_ON_SALES` tax movement type and credits the tax on sales control account

`AR_INVOICE` creates one or more credit movements in the Tax Subledger, one per resolved tax component

### AR Subledger treatment

A valid AR Counterparty must be specified at the document header level.

`AR_INVOICE` creates a single debit movement in the AR Subledger for the invoice, against the specified counterparty. The AR entry's open amount equals the invoice gross amount and is reduced by subsequent `AR_RECEIPT` allocations.

### Inventory treatment

AR_INVOICE is inventory aware. Supply `inventory_item_code` on a line level to link an invoice line to an inventory item. If the inventory item code is not found the transaction will be rejected. If the number of items supplied exceed inventory stock levels for that master item, then inventory items on hand will become negative. 

An AR_INVOICE document that supplies an `inventory_item_code` will automatically genrate an `INVENTORY_ISSUE` document, creating an inventory journal with an `INVENTORY_ISSUE` movement code.

For more information see the [inventory issue](./inventory_issue.md) documentation.

### Date treatment

Invoice date must be supplied. Posting date may be supplied, if not supplied it will default to the Invoice Date.

### Bank Details

`AR_INVOICE` does not accept bank details. Supplying `bank_cash_details` is rejected because this document does not post to a Bank / Cash account.

### Dimensions treatment

`AR_INVOICE` supports optional dimensions.

## Use cases

### Simple single-line invoice

A simple domestic invoice for one line of services, taxed at the standard NZ GST rate.

### Single tax rule resolving to multiple tax authorities (Canada / BC)

A British Columbia company issues an invoice taxed at the standard rate. In BC the standard tax treatment combines two authorities — federal GST (5%) and provincial PST (7%) — so the single line `tax_rule: "CA_BC_STANDARD"` resolves to **two** tax components, each producing its own tax subledger entry and its own credit journal line.

Request:

```jsonc
{
  "document_type": "AR_INVOICE",
  "company_code": "CA_BC_COMPANY_001",
  "ar_counterparty_code": "CUST_BC_001",
