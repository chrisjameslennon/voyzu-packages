## Financial / Ledger Treatment Principles

### Journal treatment

The engine debits AP trade payables and credits the write-off income posting code.

```txt
Dr AP_TRADE_PAYABLES             250.00
  Cr 452000  250.00
```

### Posting Code Slots

| Slot name                          | Scope  | Description                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `write_off_income_posting_code`    | Header | Optional posting-code slot used to select the write-off income posting target. If omitted, the default is used. |

### Tax treatment

AP\_WRITE\_OFF has no direct tax treatment and creates no Tax Ledger entries.

### AP Subledger treatment

`AP_WRITE_OFF` creates debit AP Subledger movements against the target bill open items.

Write-off amounts reduce bill open balances.

### Inventory treatment

AP\_WRITE\_OFF has no inventory implications and creates no Inventory Ledger entries.

### Date treatment

`write_off_date` must be supplied. `posting_date` may be supplied. If not supplied, `posting_date` defaults to `write_off_date`.

### Bank Details

`AP_WRITE_OFF` does not accept bank details. Supplying `bank_cash_details` is rejected because this document does not post to a Bank / Cash account.

### Dimensions treatment

`AP_WRITE_OFF` does not support dimensions. If dimensions are supplied, the transaction is rejected.

## Use cases

### Write off part of a bill balance

```txt
Dr AP_TRADE_PAYABLES             250.00
  Cr 452000  250.00

AP Subledger:
  Debit: 250.00
  Applied to: AP_BILL BILL-1001
  Effect: reduces bill open amount
```

## Considerations

* Write-offs are made to AP open items, not bill lines.
* Write-off amounts cannot exceed open balances.
* A write-off does not reverse purchase, expense, or tax.
