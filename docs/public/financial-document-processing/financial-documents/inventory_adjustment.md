The INVENTORY_ADJUSTMENT posting endpoint records inventory quantity corrections and value corrections in the Inventory Ledger.

INVENTORY_ADJUSTMENT is a financial inventory document. It does not manage operational stock, warehouses, bins, serial numbers, batches, fulfilment, or stock availability. It records the financial movement of an inventory item definition/SKU and posts the resulting book value movement to the Company Ledger.

## Request Object

An Inventory Adjustment Financial Document is POST-ed to the endpoint. This is a JSON object containing all values needed to create the inventory ledger movement and the related Company Ledger journal.

This request object has the following notable properties:

* Multiple adjustment lines per document are supported.
* Each line must specify an `inventory_item_code`.
* Quantity adjustments change quantity and book value.
* Value adjustments change book value only.
* Value adjustments supply a `book_value_delta`, not a new total item value.
* The Inventory Control posting target is resolved from Inventory Settings and cannot be overridden by the caller.
* The offset GL code is resolved from the item category's posting profile based on whether the value movement is positive or negative.
* Bank / Cash details are not accepted.
* Optional dimensions are supported at line level and attach to the inventory journal line.

**Annotated Example:**

```jsonc
{
  // Required. Posting document type. Must be "INVENTORY_ADJUSTMENT".
  "document_type": "INVENTORY_ADJUSTMENT",

  // Required. Company code.
  "company_code": "NZ_COMPANY_001",

  // Optional. Caller document identifier; generated if omitted.
  "document_id": "INV-ADJ-1001",

  // Optional. Caller document reference / memo.
  "memo": "May stocktake corrections",

  // Required. Date of the inventory adjustment event.
  "adjustment_date": "2026-05-12",

  // Optional. Journal posting date. Defaults to adjustment_date.
  "posting_date": "2026-05-12",

  // Required. The source of this document.
  "source": {
    "source_document": "SELF"
  },

  // Required. Inventory adjustment lines.
  "lines": [
    {
      // Required. Inventory item / SKU definition.
      "inventory_item_code": "SKU-WID-001",

      // Required. Quantity or value adjustment.
      "adjustment_type": "QUANTITY_ADJUSTMENT",

      // Required for QUANTITY_ADJUSTMENT.
      // Can be positive or negative.
      "quantity_delta": "-5",

      // Optional. Reason used for audit and reporting.
      "reason_code": "STOCKTAKE_VARIANCE",

      // Optional. Dimensions for reporting.
      "dimensions": {
        "LOCATION": "MAIN"
      }
    },
    {
      "inventory_item_code": "SKU-WID-001",
      "adjustment_type": "VALUE_ADJUSTMENT",

      // Required for VALUE_ADJUSTMENT.
      // This is a delta, not the new total item value.
      "book_value_delta": "-300.00",
      "reason_code": "VALUE_CORRECTION"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Response Object

The response to an INVENTORY_ADJUSTMENT request is an object containing three sub-objects:

* `detailed_document` The validated inventory adjustment. Includes calculated unit value used, book value deltas, and posting treatment.
* `inventory_ledger_details` Inventory Ledger movements resulting from the adjustment.
* `posting_details` Details of the Company Ledger journal.

```json
{
  "detailed_document": { /* ... */ },
  "inventory_ledger_details": { /* ... */ },
  "posting_details": { /* ... */ }
}
```

For a `?preview` request the response shape is identical; status fields on inventory ledger and journal records will be `EPHEMERAL` instead of `POSTED`.

## Adjustment types

| Adjustment type | Caller supplies | Calculates | Typical use |
| --------------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| `QUANTITY_ADJUSTMENT` | `quantity_delta` | `book_value_delta` | Stocktake variance, write-on, write-off, damage, shrinkage |
| `VALUE_ADJUSTMENT` | `book_value_delta` | New average unit value | Value-only revaluation or correction |

For positive quantity adjustments, the caller may also supply `unit_book_value` when the value of the added units is known. If omitted, the current average unit book value is used.

## Financial / Ledger Treatment Principles

### Journal treatment

The Inventory Control side is resolved from Inventory Settings. The other GL code depends on the movement and whether the book value movement is positive or negative.

```txt
INVENTORY_RECEIPT - positive correction / write-on

  Dr Inventory Settings.inventory_control_posting_code
    Cr Item Posting Profile.adjustment_gain_code

INVENTORY_ISSUE - negative correction / write-off

  Dr Item Posting Profile.adjustment_loss_code
    Cr Inventory Settings.inventory_control_posting_code

INVENTORY_QUANTITY_ADJUSTMENT / INVENTORY_VALUE_ADJUSTMENT - positive value movement

  Dr Inventory Settings.inventory_control_posting_code
    Cr Item Posting Profile.adjustment_gain_code

INVENTORY_QUANTITY_ADJUSTMENT / INVENTORY_VALUE_ADJUSTMENT - negative value movement

  Dr Item Posting Profile.adjustment_loss_code
    Cr Inventory Settings.inventory_control_posting_code
```

### Inventory Ledger movement codes

The Inventory Ledger uses the following movement codes:

| Movement code | Quantity effect | Book value effect | Typical source | Can be used in inventory adjustment |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `INVENTORY_RECEIPT` | Positive | Positive | `INVENTORY_RECEIPT`, `AP_BILL`, opening stock | Yes |
| `INVENTORY_ISSUE` | Negative | Negative | `AR_INVOICE` sold inventory line, internal issue | Yes |
| `INVENTORY_QUANTITY_ADJUSTMENT` | Positive or negative | Positive or negative | Stocktake, write-on, write-off, damage, shrinkage | Yes |
| `INVENTORY_VALUE_ADJUSTMENT` | Zero | Positive or negative | Value-only revaluation or correction | Yes |

### Inventory Ledger treatment

Quantity adjustments affect both quantity balance and book value balance.

```txt
quantity_delta = supplied quantity_delta
book_value_delta = quantity_delta * current_average_unit_book_value
```

Value adjustments affect book value balance only.

```txt
quantity_delta = 0
book_value_delta = supplied book_value_delta
```

If a UI allows the user to enter a target total item value, it should resolve that to a `book_value_delta` before posting.

```txt
book_value_delta = target_book_value_balance - current_book_value_balance
```

### Posting Code Slots

INVENTORY_ADJUSTMENT does not support caller-supplied posting code slots.

### Tax treatment

INVENTORY_ADJUSTMENT has no direct tax treatment and creates no Tax Ledger entries.

Inventory adjustment values are tax-exclusive. If a non-recoverable tax amount forms part of inventory carrying value, adjust the resulting book value only; no Tax Ledger entry is created.

### Date treatment

`adjustment_date` must be supplied. `posting_date` may be supplied. If not supplied, `posting_date` defaults to `adjustment_date`.

### Bank Details

INVENTORY_ADJUSTMENT does not accept bank details. Supplying `bank_cash_details` is rejected because this document does not post to a Bank / Cash account.

### Dimensions treatment

INVENTORY_ADJUSTMENT supports optional line-level dimensions. Dimensions attach to the Inventory journal line.

## Use cases

### Negative quantity adjustment

A stocktake finds 5 fewer units than the inventory ledger balance. The issue value is calculated from the current average unit value.

```txt
Assume current average unit value: 50.91

Calculation:

  quantity_delta = -5
  book_value_delta = -5 * 50.91
  book_value_delta = -254.55

Ledger:

  Dr Item Posting Profile.adjustment_loss_code  254.55
    Cr Inventory Control                        254.55

Inventory Ledger:

  Movement:             INVENTORY_QUANTITY_ADJUSTMENT
  Quantity delta:       -5
  Unit value supplied:  -
  Book value delta:     -254.55
```

### Positive quantity adjustment with supplied unit value

A stocktake finds 3 extra units and the caller supplies a unit value of 48.00.

```txt
Calculation:

  quantity_delta = 3
  unit_value_supplied = 48.00
  book_value_delta = 3 * 48.00
  book_value_delta = 144.00

Ledger:

  Dr Inventory Control                         144.00
    Cr Item Posting Profile.adjustment_gain_code  144.00

Inventory Ledger:

  Movement:             INVENTORY_QUANTITY_ADJUSTMENT
  Quantity delta:       3
  Unit value supplied:  48.00
  Book value delta:     144.00
```

### Value-only adjustment

A value correction reduces the carrying value of an item by 300.00 without changing quantity.

```txt
Calculation:

  quantity_delta = 0
  book_value_delta = -300.00

Ledger:

  Dr Item Posting Profile.adjustment_loss_code  300.00
    Cr Inventory Control                        300.00

Inventory Ledger:

  Movement:             INVENTORY_VALUE_ADJUSTMENT
  Quantity delta:       0
  Unit value supplied:  -
  Book value delta:     -300.00
```

## Considerations

* INVENTORY_ADJUSTMENT is for corrections to inventory quantity or book value.
* Value-only adjustments supply a delta, not a new total item value.
* `book_value_delta` is resolved and stored because it is the amount posted to Inventory Control.
* Positive value movements use the item's `adjustment_gain_code`.
* Negative value movements use the item's `adjustment_loss_code`.
