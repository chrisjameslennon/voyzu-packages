## Financial / Ledger Treatment Principles

### Journal treatment

The engine debits the write-off expense posting code and credits AR trade receivables.

```txt
Dr 610000             250.00
  Cr AR_TRADE_RECEIVABLES       250.00
```

### Posting Code Slots

| Slot name                           | Scope  | Description                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `write_off_expense_posting_code`    | Header | Optional posting-code slot used to select the write-off expense posting target. If omitted, the default is used. |

### Tax treatment

AR\_WRITE\_OFF has no direct tax treatment and creates no Tax Ledger entries.

### AR Subledger treatment

`AR_WRITE_OFF` creates credit AR Subledger movements against the target invoice open items.

Write-off amounts reduce invoice open balances.

### Inventory treatment

AR\_WRITE\_OFF has no inventory implications and creates no Inventory Ledger entries.

### Date treatment

`write_off_date` must be supplied. `posting_date` may be supplied. If not supplied, `posting_date` defaults to `write_off_date`.

### Bank Details

`AR_WRITE_OFF` does not accept bank details. Supplying `bank_cash_details` is rejected because this document does not post to a Bank / Cash account.

### Dimensions treatment

`AR_WRITE_OFF` does not support dimensions. If dimensions are supplied, the transaction is rejected.

## Use cases

### Write off part of an invoice balance

```txt
Dr 610000             250.00
  Cr AR_TRADE_RECEIVABLES       250.00

AR Subledger:
  Credit: 250.00
  Applied to: AR_INVOICE INV-1001
  Effect: reduces invoice open amount
```

## Considerations

* Write-offs are made to AR open items, not invoice lines.
* Write-off amounts cannot exceed invoice open balances.
* A write-off does not reverse revenue or tax.
