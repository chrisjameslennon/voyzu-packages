The AP\_PAYMENT endpoint records a supplier payment and posts it to the Company Ledger and Accounts Payable Subledger.

### Request Object

This request object has the following notable properties:

* A single AP Counterparty per document is supported.
* Multiple allocations may be supplied, provided all target bills belong to the same counterparty.
* A single Bank / Cash account is supported.
* If `bank_cash_account_code` is omitted, the configured document default Bank / Cash account is used.
* If `bank_cash_account_code` is supplied, it overrides the document default and must identify a valid active Bank / Cash account for the company.
* If no allocations are supplied, the payment is held as unapplied supplier payment.
* If `payment_amount` exceeds allocations, the remainder is held as unapplied supplier payment.

## Financial / Ledger Treatment Principles

### Journal treatment

The engine debits AP control accounts and credits the selected Bank / Cash account.

```txt
Dr AP_TRADE_PAYABLES           1,150.00
  Cr BANK_OPERATING            1,150.00
```

If part of the payment is unapplied:

```txt
Dr AP_TRADE_PAYABLES           1,150.00
Dr AP_UNAPPLIED_SUPPLIER_PAYMENTS 50.00
  Cr BANK_OPERATING            1,200.00
```

### Bank / Cash account selection

| Slot name                  | Scope  | Description                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bank_cash_account_code`   | Header | Optional Bank / Cash account slot used to select the payment bank/cash posting target. If omitted, the configured default is used. |

### Tax treatment

AP\_PAYMENT has no direct tax treatment and creates no Tax Ledger entries.

### AP Subledger treatment

`AP_PAYMENT` creates debit AP Subledger movements for the specified counterparty.

Allocated amounts reduce bill open balances. Unallocated amounts create unapplied supplier payment.

### Inventory treatment

AP\_PAYMENT has no inventory implications and creates no Inventory Ledger entries.

### Date treatment

`payment_date` must be supplied. `posting_date` may be supplied. If not supplied, `posting_date` defaults to `payment_date`.

### Bank Details

AP\_PAYMENT supports Bank / Cash details.

If `bank_cash_account_code` is omitted, the configured AP\_PAYMENT Bank / Cash account default is used. If supplied, `bank_cash_account_code` overrides the default and must identify a valid active Bank / Cash account for the company. Voyzu resolves the selected Bank / Cash account to its linked GL account.

If `bank_cash_details` is supplied, it records transaction/reference details for the selected Bank / Cash account.

### Dimensions treatment

`AP_PAYMENT` does not support dimensions. If dimensions are supplied, the transaction is rejected.

## Use cases

### Fully pay a bill

```txt
Dr AP_TRADE_PAYABLES           1,150.00
  Cr BANK_OPERATING            1,150.00

AP Subledger:
  Debit: 1,150.00
  Applied to: AP_BILL BILL-1001
  Effect: bill settled
```

### Overpay a bill

```txt
Dr AP_TRADE_PAYABLES           1,150.00
Dr AP_UNAPPLIED_SUPPLIER_PAYMENTS 50.00
  Cr BANK_OPERATING            1,200.00

AP Subledger:
  Debit: 1,150.00 applied to bill
  Debit: 50.00 held as unapplied supplier payment
```

## Considerations

* Payment allocations are made to AP open items, not bill lines.
* No purchase, expense, or tax is created by a payment.
