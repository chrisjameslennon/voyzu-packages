The INVENTORY_ISSUE posting endpoint records inventory quantity and book value leaving the Inventory Ledger.

INVENTORY_ISSUE is a financial inventory document. It does not manage operational stock, warehouses, bins, serial numbers, batches, fulfilment, or stock availability. It records the financial movement of an inventory item definition/SKU and posts the resulting book value movement to the Company Ledger.

Inventory issues can be created in two ways:

* Directly, by posting an `INVENTORY_ISSUE` document to this endpoint.
* Indirectly, where another source document such as an `AR_INVOICE` creates a generated inventory issue entry for an inventory item line.

## Request Object

An Inventory Issue Financial Document is POST-ed to the endpoint. This is a JSON object containing all values needed to create the inventory ledger movement and the related Company Ledger journal.

This request object has the following notable properties:

* Multiple issue lines per document are supported.
* Each line must specify an `inventory_item_code`.
* Each line must specify a negative `quantity_delta`.
* The issue book value is calculated from the item's current average unit book value.
* The Inventory Control posting target is resolved from Inventory Settings and cannot be overridden by the caller.
* The offset GL code is resolved from the item category's posting profile based on the issue purpose.
* Bank / Cash details are not accepted.
* Optional dimensions are supported at line level and attach to the inventory journal line.

**Annotated Example:**

```jsonc
{
  // Required. Posting document type. Must be "INVENTORY_ISSUE".
  "document_type": "INVENTORY_ISSUE",

  // Required. Company code.
  "company_code": "NZ_COMPANY_001",

  // Optional. Caller document identifier; generated if omitted.
  "document_id": "INV-ISS-1001",

  // Optional. Caller document reference / memo.
  "memo": "Generated issue for customer invoice SAMP-INV-002",

  // Required. Date of the inventory issue event.
  "issue_date": "2026-05-10",

  // Optional. Journal posting date. Defaults to issue_date.
  "posting_date": "2026-05-10",

  // Required. The source of this document.
  "source": {
    // Use "SELF" when directly supplied.
    // Use the generating document type when produced by another financial document.
    "source_document": "AR_INVOICE",
    "source_document_id": "SAMP-INV-002"
  },

  // Required. Inventory issue lines.
  "lines": [
    {
      // Required. Inventory item / SKU definition.
      "inventory_item_code": "SKU-WID-001",

      // Required. Quantity movement out of inventory.
      // Must be negative for INVENTORY_ISSUE.
      "quantity_delta": "-15",

      // Required for directly supplied issues.
      // SOLD uses the item category posting profile cogs_code.
      // CONSUMED uses the item category posting profile consumption_code.
      "issue_purpose": "SOLD",

      // Optional. Dimensions for reporting.
      "dimensions": {
        "LOCATION": "MAIN",
        "SALES_CHANNEL": "ONLINE"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Response Object

The response to an INVENTORY_ISSUE request is an object containing three sub-objects:

* `detailed_document` The validated inventory issue. Includes calculated unit value used, book value deltas, and posting treatment.
* `inventory_ledger_details` Inventory Ledger movements resulting from the issue.
* `posting_details` Details of the Company Ledger journal.

```json
{
  "detailed_document": { /* ... */ },
  "inventory_ledger_details": { /* ... */ },
  "posting_details": { /* ... */ }
}
```

For a `?preview` request the response shape is identical; status fields on inventory ledger and journal records will be `EPHEMERAL` instead of `POSTED`.

## Financial / Ledger Treatment Principles

### Journal treatment

The Inventory Control side is resolved from Inventory Settings. The other GL code depends on the issue purpose and the item category's posting profile.

```txt
INVENTORY_ISSUE - sold item

  Dr Item Posting Profile.cogs_code
    Cr Inventory Settings.inventory_control_posting_code

INVENTORY_ISSUE - internally consumed item

  Dr Item Posting Profile.consumption_code
    Cr Inventory Settings.inventory_control_posting_code
```

### Inventory Ledger movement codes

The Inventory Ledger uses the following movement codes:

| Movement code | Quantity effect | Book value effect | Typical source | Used in inventory issue |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| `INVENTORY_RECEIPT` | Positive | Positive | `INVENTORY_RECEIPT`, `AP_BILL`, opening stock | No |
| `INVENTORY_ISSUE` | Negative | Negative | `AR_INVOICE` sold inventory line, internal issue | Yes |
| `INVENTORY_QUANTITY_ADJUSTMENT` | Positive or negative | Positive or negative | Stocktake, write-on, write-off, damage, shrinkage | No |
| `INVENTORY_VALUE_ADJUSTMENT` | Zero | Positive or negative | Value-only revaluation or correction | No |

### Inventory Ledger treatment

INVENTORY_ISSUE creates negative quantity movements and negative book value movements in the Inventory Ledger.

The issue value is calculated from the item's current average unit book value.

```txt
book_value_delta = quantity_delta * current_average_unit_book_value
```

`unit_value_supplied` is normally blank for issues because the source document supplies quantity, not the inventory carrying value.

### Posting Code Slots

INVENTORY_ISSUE does not support caller-supplied posting code slots.

### Tax treatment

INVENTORY_ISSUE has no direct tax treatment and creates no Tax Ledger entries.

Inventory ledger values are tax-exclusive. Any sales tax on the source sale is handled by the source document and Tax Ledger; if non-recoverable tax was capitalised into inventory, it is already part of the item's carrying value.

If inventory is sold through an AR invoice, customer tax is handled by `AR_INVOICE`. The generated inventory issue records the inventory quantity and book value movement only.

### Date treatment

`issue_date` must be supplied. `posting_date` may be supplied. If not supplied, `posting_date` defaults to `issue_date`.

### Bank Details

INVENTORY_ISSUE does not accept bank details. Supplying `bank_cash_details` is rejected because this document does not post to a Bank / Cash account.

### Dimensions treatment

INVENTORY_ISSUE supports optional line-level dimensions. Dimensions attach to the Inventory journal line.

## Generated issue from AR_INVOICE

When an `AR_INVOICE` line references an inventory item, the invoice may generate an `INVENTORY_ISSUE` from that AR invoice line.

The AR invoice is the source financial document. The inventory issue is the inventory-ledger representation of the inventory effect.

```jsonc
{
  // Source AR invoice line.
  "document_type": "AR_INVOICE",
  "document_id": "SAMP-INV-002",
  "invoice_date": "2026-05-10",
  "posting_date": "2026-05-10",
  "lines": [
    {
      "line_id": 1,
      "inventory_item_code": "SKU-WID-001",
      "description": "Standard Widget",
      "quantity": "15"
    }
  ]
}
```

Generated inventory issue line:

```jsonc
{
  "document_type": "INVENTORY_ISSUE",
  "document_id": "INV-ISS-10523",
  "issue_date": "2026-05-10",
  "posting_date": "2026-05-10",
  "source": {
    "source_type": "GENERATED_FROM_AR_INVOICE",
    "source_document_type": "AR_INVOICE",
    "source_document_id": "SAMP-INV-002",
    "source_line_id": 1
  },
  "lines": [
    {
      "line_id": 1,
      "inventory_item_code": "SKU-WID-001",
      "quantity_delta": "-15",
      "movement": "INVENTORY_ISSUE",
      "unit_book_value_used": "50.91",
      "book_value_delta": "-763.65"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Use cases

### AR invoice generated issue

An AR invoice sells 15 units. The issue value is calculated from the current average unit value.

```txt
Assume current average unit value: 50.91

Calculation:

  book_value_delta = -15 * 50.91
  book_value_delta = -763.65

Ledger:

  Dr Item Posting Profile.cogs_code   763.65
    Cr Inventory Control              763.65

Inventory Ledger:

  Movement:             INVENTORY_ISSUE
  Issue purpose:        SOLD
  Quantity delta:       -15
  Unit value supplied:  -
  Book value delta:     -763.65
```

### Internal consumption issue

Packaging inventory is consumed during fulfilment. The issue value is calculated from the current average unit value and posted to the item's consumption code.

```txt
Assume current average unit value: 1.50

Calculation:

  book_value_delta = -40 * 1.50
  book_value_delta = -60.00

Ledger:

  Dr Item Posting Profile.consumption_code   60.00
    Cr Inventory Control                     60.00

Inventory Ledger:

  Movement:             INVENTORY_ISSUE
  Issue purpose:        CONSUMED
  Quantity delta:       -40
  Unit value supplied:  -
  Book value delta:     -60.00
```

## Considerations

* INVENTORY_ISSUE is for inventory value leaving the Inventory Ledger.
* Issue value is calculated from the current average unit book value.
* `book_value_delta` is resolved and stored because it is the amount posted to Inventory Control.
* Items must be enabled for sale or consumption depending on the issue purpose.
