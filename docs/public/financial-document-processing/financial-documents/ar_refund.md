## Financial / Ledger Treatment Principles

### Journal treatment

The engine debits unapplied customer balance and credits the selected Bank / Cash account.

```txt
Dr AR_UNAPPLIED_CREDIT          500.00
  Cr BANK_OPERATING             500.00
```

### Bank / Cash account selection

| Slot name                  | Scope  | Description                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bank_cash_account_code`   | Header | Optional Bank / Cash account slot used to select the refund bank/cash posting target. If omitted, the configured default is used. |

### Tax treatment

AR\_REFUND has no direct tax treatment and creates no Tax Ledger entries.

### AR Subledger treatment

`AR_REFUND` reduces the customer's available unapplied AR balance.

### Inventory treatment

AR\_REFUND has no inventory implications and creates no Inventory Ledger entries.

### Date treatment

`refund_date` must be supplied. `posting_date` may be supplied. If not supplied, `posting_date` defaults to `refund_date`.

### Bank Details

AR\_REFUND supports Bank / Cash details.

If `bank_cash_account_code` is omitted, the configured AR\_REFUND Bank / Cash account default is used. If supplied, `bank_cash_account_code` overrides the default and must identify a valid active Bank / Cash account for the company. Voyzu resolves the selected Bank / Cash account to its linked GL account.

If `bank_cash_details` is supplied, it records transaction/reference details for the selected Bank / Cash account.

### Dimensions treatment

`AR_REFUND` does not support dimensions. If dimensions are supplied, the transaction is rejected.

## Use cases

### Refund available unapplied customer balance

```txt
Dr AR_UNAPPLIED_CREDIT          500.00
  Cr BANK_OPERATING             500.00

AR Subledger:
  Debit: 500.00 against unapplied customer balance
  Effect: pays money back to the customer
```

## Considerations

* Refunds are made from unapplied customer balance, not invoice lines.
* Refund amounts cannot exceed available unapplied balance.
* No revenue or tax is created or reversed by a refund.
