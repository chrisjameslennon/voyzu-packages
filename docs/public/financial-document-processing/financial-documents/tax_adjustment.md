## Financial / Ledger Treatment Principles

### Journal treatment

The engine posts one side to the selected tax control account and the other side to the adjustment offset account.

```txt
  TAX_ADJUSTMENT

  Ledger (typical use case):

  Dr Tax adjustment offset
    Cr TAX_ON_SALES

  BY WAY OF:

    Voyzu journal:
      Dr 603000 Posting Code,
        or supplied General Ledger Account in adjustment_gl_account_code document property
        Cr TAX_ON_SALES Control Account
```

### Combinations

```txt
TAX_ON_SALES + INCREASES_TAX_PAYABLE

Dr 603000
  Cr TAX_ON_SALES
```

```txt
TAX_ON_SALES + REDUCES_TAX_PAYABLE

Dr TAX_ON_SALES
  Cr 603000
```

```txt
TAX_ON_PURCHASES + INCREASES_TAX_RECOVERABLE

Dr TAX_ON_PURCHASES
  Cr 603000
```

```txt
TAX_ON_PURCHASES + REDUCES_TAX_RECOVERABLE

Dr 603000
  Cr TAX_ON_PURCHASES
```

### Posting Code Slots

The tax side does not provide a caller-supplied posting code slot or GL override.

The tax side always resolves through the configured tax control account selected by `tax_movement_code`.

Default offset posting targets are configured in Voyzu. `adjustment_gl_account_code` may be supplied as a direct GL override for the adjustment offset side.

### Tax Ledger treatment

TAX\_ADJUSTMENT creates a Tax Ledger movement against the supplied tax authority. The debit or credit direction follows the selected `tax_movement_code` and `adjustment_effect`.

### Inventory treatment

TAX\_ADJUSTMENT has no inventory implications and creates no Inventory Ledger entries.

### Date treatment

`adjustment_date` must be supplied. `posting_date` may be supplied. If not supplied, `posting_date` defaults to `adjustment_date`.

### Bank Details

TAX\_ADJUSTMENT does not accept bank details. Supplying `bank_cash_details` is rejected because this document does not post to a Bank / Cash account.

### Dimensions treatment

TAX\_ADJUSTMENT does not support dimensions. If dimensions are supplied, the transaction is rejected.

## Use cases

### Increase tax payable

An authority assessment increases output tax payable.

```txt
Ledger:

  TAX_ADJUSTMENT TAX-ADJ-1001

  Dr Tax Adjustments               75.00
    Cr Tax on Sales - Payable      75.00

  BY WAY OF:

    Voyzu journal:
      Dr 603000 Posting Code,
        or supplied General Ledger Account in adjustment_gl_account_code document property
                                      75.00
        Cr TAX_ON_SALES Control Account 75.00

Tax Ledger Treatment:

  TAX-30000
    Document: TAX_ADJUSTMENT TAX-ADJ-1001
    Tax authority: IRD
    Tax movement: TAX_ON_SALES
    Debit: -
    Credit: 75.00
    Effect: increases tax payable
```

### Reduce tax recoverable

An authority assessment reduces input tax recoverable.

```txt
Ledger:

  TAX_ADJUSTMENT TAX-ADJ-1002

  Dr Tax Adjustments                  40.00
    Cr Tax on Purchases - Recoverable 40.00

  BY WAY OF:

    Voyzu journal:
      Dr 603000 Posting Code,
        or supplied General Ledger Account in adjustment_gl_account_code document property
                                            40.00
        Cr TAX_ON_PURCHASES Control Account 40.00

Tax Ledger Treatment:

  TAX-30001
    Document: TAX_ADJUSTMENT TAX-ADJ-1002
    Tax authority: IRD
    Tax movement: TAX_ON_PURCHASES
    Debit: -
    Credit: 40.00
    Effect: reduces tax recoverable
```

## Considerations

* TAX\_ADJUSTMENT records tax balance changes outside AR/AP source documents.
* Adjustments relate to one tax authority per document.
* Invalid combinations of `tax_movement_code` and `adjustment_effect` are rejected.
* `adjustment_amount` must be supplied as a positive amount. Negative adjustment amounts are rejected.
