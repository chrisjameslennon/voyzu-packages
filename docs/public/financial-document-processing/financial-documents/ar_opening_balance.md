## Financial / Ledger Treatment Principles

### Journal treatment

The engine debits AR trade receivables and credits the opening balance equity posting code.

```txt
Dr AR_TRADE_RECEIVABLES         3,000.00
  Cr OPENING_BALANCE_EQUITY     3,000.00
```

### Posting Code Slots

| Slot name                                | Scope  | Description                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `opening_balance_equity_posting_code`    | Header | Optional posting-code slot used to select the opening balance equity posting target. If omitted, the default is used. |

### Tax treatment

AR\_OPENING\_BALANCE has no direct tax treatment and creates no Tax Ledger entries.

### AR Subledger treatment

`AR_OPENING_BALANCE` creates debit AR Subledger movements for the specified counterparty.

Each item creates an opening AR open item that can later be settled by normal AR documents.

### Inventory treatment

AR\_OPENING\_BALANCE has no direct inventory treatment and creates no Inventory Ledger entries.

If an inventory ledger opening balance is required, use an inventory document such as `INVENTORY_RECEIPT` or `INVENTORY_ADJUSTMENT`.

### Date treatment

`opening_balance_date` must be supplied. `posting_date` may be supplied. If not supplied, `posting_date` defaults to `opening_balance_date`.

### Bank Details

`AR_OPENING_BALANCE` does not accept bank details. Supplying `bank_cash_details` is rejected because this document does not post to a Bank / Cash account.

### Dimensions treatment

`AR_OPENING_BALANCE` does not support dimensions. If dimensions are supplied, the transaction is rejected.

## Use cases

### Seed opening customer receivables

```txt
Dr AR_TRADE_RECEIVABLES         3,000.00
  Cr OPENING_BALANCE_EQUITY     3,000.00

AR Subledger:
  Debit: 3,000.00
  Counterparty: CUST_001
  Effect: creates opening AR open item
```

## Considerations

* Opening balances are for migration or system setup.
* Opening balances do not create revenue or tax.
* Opening AR items can be settled by normal AR documents after migration.
