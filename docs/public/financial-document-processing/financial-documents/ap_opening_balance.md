The AP\_OPENING\_BALANCE endpoint seeds opening supplier payable balances during migration or system setup. Use this document when an opening balance has been established for a given counterparty but there isn't the necessary evidence to enter an `AP_BILL` document. Note that line information is only provided for reference, an open item will not be created

### Request Object

This request object has the following notable properties:

* A single AP Counterparty per document is supported.
* Multiple opening AP items may be supplied.
* Opening balances create AP open items.

## Financial / Ledger Treatment Principles

### Journal treatment

The engine debits the opening balance equity posting code and credits AP trade payables.

```txt
Dr OPENING_BALANCE_EQUITY       3,000.00
  Cr AP_TRADE_PAYABLES          3,000.00
```

### Posting Code Slots

| Slot name                             | Scope  | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `opening_balance_equity_posting_code` | Header | Optional posting-code slot used to select the opening balance equity posting target. If omitted, the default is used. |

### Tax treatment

AP\_OPENING\_BALANCE has no direct tax treatment and creates no Tax Ledger entries.

### AP Subledger treatment

`AP_OPENING_BALANCE` creates credit AP Subledger movements for the specified counterparty.

Each item creates an opening AP open item that can later be settled by normal AP documents.

### Inventory treatment

AP\_OPENING\_BALANCE has no direct inventory treatment and creates no Inventory Ledger entries.

If an inventory ledger opening balance is required, use an inventory document such as `INVENTORY_RECEIPT` or `INVENTORY_ADJUSTMENT`.

### Date treatment

`opening_balance_date` must be supplied. `posting_date` may be supplied. If not supplied, `posting_date` defaults to `opening_balance_date`.

### Bank Details

`AP_OPENING_BALANCE` does not accept bank details. Supplying `bank_cash_details` is rejected because this document does not post to a Bank / Cash account.

### Dimensions treatment

`AP_OPENING_BALANCE` does not support dimensions. If dimensions are supplied, the transaction is rejected.

## Use cases

### Seed opening supplier payables

```txt
Dr OPENING_BALANCE_EQUITY       3,000.00
  Cr AP_TRADE_PAYABLES          3,000.00

AP Subledger:
  Credit: 3,000.00
  Counterparty: SUPP_001
  Effect: creates opening AP open item
```

## Considerations

* Opening balances are for migration or system setup.
* Opening balances do not create purchase, expense, or tax.
* Opening AP items can be settled by normal AP documents after migration.
