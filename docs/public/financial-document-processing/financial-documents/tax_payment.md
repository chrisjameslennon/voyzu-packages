## Financial / Ledger Treatment Principles

### Journal treatment

The engine debits the tax GL account and credits the selected Bank / Cash account.

```txt
  TAX_PAYMENT

  Ledger (typical use case):

  Dr TAX_ON_SALES
    Cr Bank / cash

  BY WAY OF:

    Voyzu journal:
      Dr TAX_ON_SALES Control Account
        Cr selected Bank / Cash account
```

### Posting Code Slots

The tax side does not provide a caller-supplied posting code slot or GL override.

The tax side always resolves through the configured `TAX_ON_SALES` tax control account.

### Bank / Cash account selection

| Slot name            | Scope  | Description                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bank_cash_account_code`  | Header | Optional Bank / Cash account code used to select the payment bank/cash posting target. If omitted, the configured default is used.     |

### Tax Ledger treatment

TAX\_PAYMENT creates a debit movement in the Tax Ledger against the supplied tax authority.

```txt
Tax Ledger Treatment:

  TAX-30000
    Document: TAX_PAYMENT TAX-PAY-1001
    Tax authority: IRD
    Tax movement: Tax on Sales
    Debit: 1,000.00
    Credit: -
    Effect: records tax paid to the authority
```

### Inventory treatment

TAX\_PAYMENT has no inventory implications and creates no Inventory Ledger entries.

### Date treatment

`payment_date` must be supplied. `posting_date` may be supplied. If not supplied, `posting_date` defaults to `payment_date`.

### Bank Details

TAX\_PAYMENT supports Bank / Cash details.

If `bank_cash_account_code` is omitted, the configured TAX\_PAYMENT Bank / Cash account default is used. If supplied, `bank_cash_account_code` overrides the default and must identify a valid active Bank / Cash account code. Voyzu resolves the selected Bank / Cash account to its linked GL account.

If `bank_cash_details` is supplied, it records transaction/reference details for the selected Bank / Cash account.

### Dimensions treatment

TAX\_PAYMENT does not support dimensions. If dimensions are supplied, the transaction is rejected.

## Use cases

### Pay a tax authority

```txt
Ledger:

  TAX_PAYMENT TAX-PAY-1001

  Dr Tax on Sales - Payable        1,000.00
    Cr Bank / cash                 1,000.00

  BY WAY OF:

    Voyzu journal:
      Dr TAX_ON_SALES Control Account              1,000.00
        Cr BANK_OPERATING                          1,000.00

Tax Ledger Treatment:

  TAX-30000
    Document: TAX_PAYMENT TAX-PAY-1001
    Tax authority: IRD
    Tax movement: TAX_ON_SALES
    Debit: 1,000.00
    Credit: -
    Effect: records tax paid to the authority
```

## Considerations

* TAX\_PAYMENT records settlement activity, not AR/AP source tax.
* Payments are made to one tax authority per document.
