The AR\_RECEIPT endpoint records a customer payment and posts it to the Company Ledger and Accounts Receivable Subledger.

### Request Object

This request object has the following notable properties:

* A single AR Counterparty per document is supported.
* Multiple allocations may be supplied, provided all target invoices belong to the same counterparty.
* A single Bank / Cash account is supported.
* If `bank_cash_account_code` is omitted, the configured document default Bank / Cash account is used.
* If `bank_cash_account_code` is supplied, it overrides the document default and must identify a valid active Bank / Cash account for the company.
* If no allocations are supplied, the receipt is held as unapplied cash.

## Financial / Ledger Treatment Principles

### Journal treatment

The engine debits the selected Bank / Cash account and credits AR control accounts.

```txt
Dr BANK_OPERATING               1,150.00
  Cr AR_TRADE_RECEIVABLES       1,150.00
```

If part of the receipt is unapplied:

```txt
Dr BANK_OPERATING               1,200.00
  Cr AR_TRADE_RECEIVABLES       1,150.00
  Cr AR_UNAPPLIED_CASH             50.00
```

### Bank / Cash account selection

| Slot name                  | Scope  | Description                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bank_cash_account_code`   | Header | Optional Bank / Cash account slot used to select the receipt bank/cash posting target. If omitted, the configured default is used. |

### Tax treatment

AR\_RECEIPT has no direct tax treatment and creates no Tax Ledger entries.

### AR Subledger treatment

`AR_RECEIPT` creates credit AR Subledger movements for the specified counterparty.

Allocated amounts reduce invoice open balances. Unallocated amounts create unapplied customer credit.

### Inventory treatment

AR\_RECEIPT has no inventory implications and creates no Inventory Ledger entries.

### Date treatment

`payment_date` must be supplied. `posting_date` may be supplied. If not supplied, `posting_date` defaults to `payment_date`.

### Bank Details

AR\_RECEIPT supports Bank / Cash details.

If `bank_cash_account_code` is omitted, the configured AR\_RECEIPT Bank / Cash account default is used. If supplied, `bank_cash_account_code` overrides the default and must identify a valid active Bank / Cash account for the company. Voyzu resolves the selected Bank / Cash account to its linked GL account.

If `bank_cash_details` is supplied, it records transaction/reference details for the selected Bank / Cash account.

### Dimensions treatment

`AR_RECEIPT` does not support dimensions. If dimensions are supplied, the transaction is rejected.

## Use cases

### Fully pay an invoice

```txt
Dr BANK_OPERATING               1,150.00
  Cr AR_TRADE_RECEIVABLES       1,150.00

AR Subledger:
  Credit: 1,150.00
  Applied to: AR_INVOICE INV-1001
  Effect: invoice settled
```

### Overpay an invoice

```txt
Dr BANK_OPERATING               1,200.00
  Cr AR_TRADE_RECEIVABLES       1,150.00
  Cr AR_UNAPPLIED_CASH             50.00

AR Subledger:
  Credit: 1,150.00 applied to invoice
  Credit: 50.00 held as unapplied cash
```

## Considerations

* Receipt allocations are made to AR open items, not invoice lines.
* No revenue or tax is created by a receipt.
