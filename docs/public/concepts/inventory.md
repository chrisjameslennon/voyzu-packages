# Inventory

Voyzu treats inventory as a **financial subledger**. It records the quantity and
book value of items, then posts the financial effect of inventory movements to
the general ledger.

It is not an operational inventory or warehouse management system. Voyzu does
not manage:

- Warehouses, bins, or stock locations
- Serial numbers, batches, or individual units
- Picking, packing, fulfillment, or transfers
- Stock reservations or availability
- Physical handling and logistics

An operational system can manage those activities and send their financial
results to Voyzu.

## Items

An item represents the financial identity of something that is bought, sold,
consumed, or held as inventory. It can correspond to a SKU in another system,
but it does not contain that system's operational stock detail.

Each item has a code, name, unit, and category. Its type
determines how Voyzu treats it:

| Item type | Financial treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Inventory | Quantity and book value are maintained in the inventory ledger. |
| Non-inventory | Can be bought or sold without maintaining an inventory balance. |
| Service | Represents a service rather than physical stock. |

The category's posting profile defines whether its items may be sold, purchased,
or consumed. This keeps permitted financial operations aligned with their
related general ledger accounts.

For inventory items, Voyzu derives the current quantity on hand, total book
value, and average unit book value from posted inventory movements. These are
financial balances, not a statement of stock available at a particular
location.

## Categories

Categories group related items for classification and reporting. Each category
selects an item posting profile, so every item in the category shares the same
permitted operations and posting accounts. The company's inventory control
account provides the inventory asset side of the posting.

Organization-level items and categories act as defaults when a company is
created. The resulting company records are then decoupled, so each company can
maintain its own inventory setup.

## Posting profiles

A posting profile tells Voyzu which general ledger accounts to use for the
non-inventory side of an item's transactions. It also defines the permitted
operations for its items: sold, purchased, and consumed. The related account
fields are available only when that operation is permitted. A profile can
define accounts for:

- Revenue
- Cost of goods sold
- Purchase expense
- Consumption
- Inventory adjustment gains
- Inventory adjustment losses

Many categories can share a posting profile, and all items in a category inherit
that profile. This keeps account selection consistent without embedding general
ledger account choices in every item or transaction.

When a financial document line supplies an item, Voyzu uses the posting profile
selected by the item's category. A posting account explicitly supplied by the
financial document overrides the profile for that document only.

The inventory asset side is posted to the company's
[inventory control account](control-accounts.md). The other side is selected
from the item category's posting profile or is provided by the source financial
document.

Typical postings include:

| Movement | Debit | Credit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct inventory receipt | Inventory control | Adjustment gain |
| Sale-related inventory issue | Cost of goods sold | Inventory control |
| Consumption issue | Consumption expense | Inventory control |
| Positive inventory adjustment | Inventory control | Adjustment gain |
| Negative inventory adjustment | Adjustment loss | Inventory control |

An accounts payable bill for an inventory item can create an inventory receipt,
while an accounts receivable invoice can create an inventory issue. The source
document handles matters such as the supplier, customer, payable, receivable,
revenue, and tax. The inventory movement records the item's quantity and book
value effect without duplicating the source document's journal posting.

## Inventory movements

The inventory ledger supports four kinds of financial movement:

| Movement | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Receipt | Increases quantity and book value. |
| Issue | Decreases quantity and book value at the current average value. |
| Quantity adjustment | Corrects quantity and its associated book value. |
| Value adjustment | Corrects book value without changing quantity. |

Each movement records its source, item, quantity change, book value change, and
resulting balances. The inventory ledger therefore explains the inventory
control account balance at item level.

## Moving weighted-average book value

Voyzu uses **moving weighted-average book value**, also known as perpetual
weighted-average valuation. Inventory of the same item is treated as one pool;
Voyzu does not maintain FIFO layers or costs for batches, serial numbers, or
individual units.

The current average is:

```text
Average unit book value = total item book value / item quantity
```

When a receipt is posted, its value is combined with the existing pool:

```text
New average unit book value =
  (existing book value + receipt book value)
  / (existing quantity + receipt quantity)
```

For example, an item with 10 units valued at $100 has an average unit book value
of $10. Receiving another 10 units valued at $140 produces 20 units valued at
$240, with a new average of $12 per unit. A subsequent issue is valued at that
current $12 average.

This model gives the general ledger a continuously updated inventory value while
keeping operational stock handling outside Voyzu.
