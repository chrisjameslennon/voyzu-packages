# General Ledger Accounts

The General Ledger Accounts screens maintain the organization chart of accounts
used as standard financial settings by tethered companies.

## Concepts

* [What is a Financial Ledger?](../../concepts/what-is-a-financial-ledger.md)
  explains journals, balanced postings, and the Company Ledger.
* [Control Accounts](../../concepts/control-accounts.md) explains how supporting
  ledgers point to General Ledger accounts.
* [Organizations and Companies](../../concepts/organizations-and-companies.md)
  explains how organization financial settings flow to tethered companies.

## Viewing accounts

The list shows code, name, account type, reporting category, posting state, and
status. Search matches the account details. Filter by account type or status,
then click a row to open its detail screen.

Select accounts to activate, deactivate, or delete them when the action is
permitted. **Refresh** reloads the list. Export supports selected rows, the
current view, or the full dataset.

### In use

An account is in use when it has postings or is linked by another financial
setting. The detail screen shows **HAS POSTINGS**, affected companies, and a
**Linked By** section where applicable.

Accounts with postings cannot be deactivated or deleted. Linked accounts also
cannot be removed while another setting depends on them.

## Create a new account

Select **Add Account** and provide a unique code, name, account type, and an
active reporting category of the same account type. The account is created as
**ACTIVE**.

Choose the account type carefully. It controls the account's accounting meaning
and which reporting categories are available.

## Make changes

Open an account from the list to edit its code, name, account type, and reporting
category. Select **Save** to apply changes. Once the account is in use, preserve
its code and accounting classification so existing postings retain a stable
meaning.

Status is changed with **Activate** and **Deactivate**, not through Save. The
audit panel links to the account's organization audit events.

## Delete an account

Delete is permanent and is available only when the account has no postings and
is not referenced by another setting. Deactivate an unused account when it
should remain available for history but not for new configuration.
