# Reporting Categories

Reporting Categories group General Ledger accounts into ordered financial
statement sections within the organization standard settings.

## Concepts

* [What is a Financial Ledger?](../../concepts/what-is-a-financial-ledger.md)
  explains the General Ledger that reporting categories organize.
* [Organizations and Companies](../../concepts/organizations-and-companies.md)
  explains how standard settings flow to tethered companies.

## Viewing categories

The list shows code, name, account type, display sequence, posting state, and
status. Search matches these values. Filter by account type or status and click
a row to open its details.

Select rows to activate, deactivate, or delete them where permitted. Refresh
reloads the list, and export supports selected rows, the current view, or the
full dataset.

### In use

A category is in use when General Ledger accounts or company postings depend on
it. The detail screen shows **HAS POSTINGS** and the companies with postings.

An in-use category cannot be deleted, and changes to its account type or code
can change the meaning of accounts already grouped beneath it.

## Create a new category

Select **Add Category** and provide a unique code, name, account type, and
sequence. New categories are **ACTIVE**.

The account type determines which General Ledger accounts can use the category.
Sequence controls where the category appears relative to other categories in
reports of the same type.

## Make changes

Open a row to change the category name and supported editable details, then
select **Save**. Treat code and account type as stable once the category is in
use. Status is changed through Activate and Deactivate actions.

The audit panel links to the category's organization audit events.

## Delete a category

Delete is permanent and is available only when the category is not used by
accounts or postings. Move or remove dependent accounts before deleting a
category. Use deactivation when the category should remain in history but not
be available for new accounts.
